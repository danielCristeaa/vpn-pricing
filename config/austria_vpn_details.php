    'section_two_top_text' => 'The internet was meant to be free and open to anyone. But sadly, that’s not the case, with internet surveillance becoming the norm. Everything you do online is collected and stored. And Austria is no exception to this. The European Data Retention Directive has been a privacy nightmare for all European citizens. This threat has lurked over Austrian citizens for over a decade. And while Austrian authorities have been playing cat and mouse with its implementation, there is no guarantee of what the future holds.',

    'section_two_bottom_text' => 'However, let’s not forget that your data is being harvested with every site and social media page you frequent. Targeted ads have been a game changer for online platforms, which caused data to be collected by the bulk. Not to mention data breaches are becoming a worryingly common occurrence. Austrian businesses have also been targeted, as they usually don’t rely on cybersecurity as much as they should.',

    'section_three_text' => 'Wireless connections are so common nowadays that we don’t even stop to think the dangers they might pose. Here’s the catch. The networks you use in cafés, airports, or hotels usually lack a secure setup or even a password. This means that every time you go online using an unsecured Wi-Fi network, you risk exposing your data. You should know that cybercrime has become a very lucrative business, so hackers have every reason to keep perfecting their methods. This is worrying when you consider that there is already a multitude of malicious associations and attacks that target open Wi-Fi networks. Therefore it’s important to secure your online presence no matter where you are. Our military-grade encryption offers the best protection available and even today’s supercomputers can’t get past it.',

    'section_four_text' => 'By now, we’re mostly familiar with geo-restrictions and how frustrating they can be. Due to licensing issues many foreign TV shows and movies are restricted in Austria. Most streaming services detect your location based on your IP address. Then they decide what content is available for you to watch. One popular example of this is Netflix. Even if you have a subscription, you still can’t get the entire library of content in Austria. The same holds true for Amazon Prime or YouTube Premium. Other services, like Hulu or BBC aren’t available to view within Austrian borders at all. However, with our VPN service by your side, that’s no longer the case. CyberGhost VPN allows you to hide your IP address and replace it with another one from our network. This way, their localization software will no longer be able to detect your real location. And if you’re travelling abroad and feel homesick, CyberGhost VPN makes it easy to catch up with all from favorite shows on ORF.',
